<h1> 3-D Design </h1>
<p> Using fusion 360 I designed different objects and shapes. I spent the most time creating a phone case made specifically for my phone that has a flip out stand in the back. It tooks lots of measurement and guessing but the print .... We leanred how to 3-d model things and what it takes to make these objects printable./P>
