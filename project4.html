<h1> 3-D Design </h1>
<p> Using fusion 360 I designed different objects and shapes.
  I spent the most time creating a phone case made specifically for my phone that has a flip out stand in the back. It tooks lots of measurement and some guessing but the print only midley fit the phone. There were a few
   adjustments I could of made but, none that are worth reprinting the phone case. We leanred how to 3-d model things and what it takes to make these objects printable. </P>
